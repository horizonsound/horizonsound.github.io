  Official audio for “The Quiet After” by Horizon Sound.

  “The Quiet After” is a slow, cinematic pop‑soul ballad built around warm expressive female vocals, intimate close‑mic delivery, and a soft, resonant piano at the center. Gentle strings, subtle drums, and spacious reverb create a heartbreak‑after‑the‑storm atmosphere — the kind of quiet that feels heavier than the chaos that came before it.
  
  The song follows someone standing in the aftermath of a love that’s finally burned out. The shouting is gone, the fire has faded, and what remains is the painful clarity of silence. She walks through rooms still holding traces of what used to be — a coat by the door, a cup on the counter — realizing that the quiet things now feel louder than the love they lost. As she picks up the pieces, she begins the slow process of learning how to live again.

lyrics: |
  [INTRO]
  I still hear the whisper of your voice. 
  But the quiet’s closing in on me.
  
  [VERSE 1]
  We used to fill these rooms with passion
  Every touch a spark that roared.
  Now I’m walking through the silence
  Where love won’t burn like once before.
  There’s a cup still on the counter
  Your coat hanging by the door.
  Funny how the quiet things
  Feel louder than before.
  
  [PRE‑CHORUS]
  I thought the storm would break me
  But it’s the calm that hurts the most.
  
  [CHORUS]
  This is the quiet after—
  When the shouting fades and the truth rings louder.
  When the tears run dry and the nights grow colder,
  And the weight of what we were
  Falls heavy on our shoulders.
  No more fire, no more passion…
  Just me, picking up the pieces
  In the quiet after.
  
  [VERSE 2]
  I keep reliving every moment
  Trying to see what I ignored.
  All the warnings in your actions
  All the distance you explored.
  Now the silence feels like prison
  A sentence I can’t appeal.
  I never knew that losing you
  Would be the ache I couldn’t heal.
  
  [PRE‑CHORUS] 
  I thought our love would save us, 
  But nothing could have braced me for the pain.
  
  [CHORUS]
  This is the quiet after—
  When the shouting fades and the truth rings louder.
  When the tears run dry and the nights grow colder,
  And the weight of what we were
  Falls heavy on our shoulders.
  No more fire, no more passion…
  Just me, picking up the pieces
  In the quiet after.
  
  [BRIDGE]
  Maybe someday I’ll forgive us
  For the words we never said.
  For the love we couldn’t mend,
  For the dreams we left for dead.
  But tonight I’m stuck between us,
  In the space you used to be—
  Trying to breathe inside the silence
  In a pain that keeps its hold on me.
  
  [CHORUS]
  This is the quiet after—
  When the shouting fades and the truth rings louder.
  When the tears run dry and the nights grow colder,
  And the weight of what we were
  Falls heavy on our shoulders.
  No more fire, no more passion…
  Just me, picking up the pieces
  In the quiet after.
  And learning how to live again.
  
  [OUTRO]
  The room no longer holds your memory,
  And I’m learning how to stand here on my own.
